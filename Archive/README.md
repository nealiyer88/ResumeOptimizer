# 🗃️ Legacy Resume Parsing Modules

These modules were originally used for rule-based parsing of resume sections and job experiences.

They have been deprecated in favor of a GPT-structured parsing approach using `html_converter.py` and `gpt_parser.py`.

## Modules Archived:

- `parsing_module.py`: rule-based section splitting
- `experience_splitter.py`: regex-based job chunking
- `extract_text_pdfplumber`, etc.: raw file extractors

These are retained for reference and fallback testing only.

- Focus on integrating missing *tools, certifications, or domain expertise*
- Keep tone professional, clear, and concise
- **Avoid redundancy 
- DO NOT fabricate achievements or job titles

ðŸŽ¯ Your task:
- Naturally incorporate as many relevant missing keywords as possible.
- Only include hard skills (tools, platforms, certifications, or directly measurable capabilities).
- If the existing section includes soft skills as a subcategory, only add soft skills to that portion.
- Avoid fabricating new skills unless they are *clearly implied* by the original.
- DO NOT repeat or re-list skills already present.
- **If the skills section is organized by category, rename the category headers to align with the key themes and terminology of the job description.**

You are enhancing the 'Professional Summary' section of a resume.

The original summary is below:

---
{summary_text.strip()}

You must naturally incorporate the following missing keywords into the summary, without making it sound robotic or stuffed:

{", ".join(missing_keywords)}

ðŸŽ¯ Guidelines:
- Keep the improved summary under 60 words
- Focus on integrating missing *tools, certifications, or domain expertise*
- Keep tone professional, clear, and concise
- **Avoid redundancy 
- DO NOT fabricate achievements or job titles

Return ONLY the enhanced summary. Do not include explanations or headers.
